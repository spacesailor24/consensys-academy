## What is Proof of Existence?

Proof of Existence is a service that verifies the existence of a document or file at a specific time via timestamped transactions. PoE utilizes the one-way nature of cryptographic hash functions to reduce the amount of information that needs to be stored on the blockchain.

In this walkthrough, we are going to introduce some basic Ethereum smart contract development best practices by creating a simple proof of existence contract and interacting with it on the blockchain.
