# Public and Private Blockchains

## Public Blockchains

- Allows anyone to join the network as a trust-less participant
- Anyone can read and write data (the network is permission-less)
- Transaction processors must invest financially to prevent fraud and spam
  - In POW, this is done by miners purchasing mining rigs that have high hash rates, so that they are able to mine blocks
    - Because a transaction processor, a.k.a. miner, has to purchase a fairly expensive mining rig in order to have a chance the produce blocks, there procudes a barrier to entry and require that one spend a lot of money in order to pull of an attack such as spamming the network
  - Incentivised by direct economic incentives (usually cryptocurrencies)
    - This means that by playing nicely and following the rules, miners can earn money by processing transactions and mining for the network
- In order to process a transaction, there is usually a fee (usually called a miner's fee)
  - This also keeps users from spamming the network with transactions, because it would be realatively expensive to do so
- Examples of a Public blockchain:
    - Bitcoin
    - Ethereum

## Permissioned / Consortium Blockchains

- Only verified participants are allowed to read/write to the network
- Usually uses consensus methods other than POW
  - The allows for the network to potentially have a higher transactions throughput compared to POW Public networks

## Private Blockchains

- Designed for rapid application development, instant deployment, and single-enterprise deployment solutions
- Prototyping and development needs for learning
- Participants are known and trusted
  - Legally accountable validators incentivized by reputational risk
- Potential for a small number of nodes with ability to change data
  - This is a potential security risk if any of the validators decided to act dishonestly
